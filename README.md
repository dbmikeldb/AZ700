## AZ700 Study Repo
This repo contains all the technology I deployed while studying for my AZ700 exam in the order I studied them, following Microsoft's official self-paced study guide here:
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/paths/design-implement-microsoft-azure-networking-solutions-az-700/
.

I done 1-2 deployments of each resource via the Azure portal but that very quickly become tedious work so moved to Powershell scripts.

The code here and the infrastructure it deploys are not intended to provide a complete study experience but simply to partially automate the process of setting up environments to study within.

Microsoft's documentation should be referenced to understand the technology in the detail required to pass this exam.
